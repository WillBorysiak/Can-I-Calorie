<h2 align="center">How The Application Works</h2>

- The application uses Angular to render the user interface via its component based architecture and build in modules.
- SASS is used to style my custom Angular components with css, variables and mixins.
- Angular Material was used to provide some prebuilt functional components that can be styled via the Angular config.
- NgRx is used to manage the state of the application by sending data from the store to the components.

<h2 align="center">What I Learnt</h2>

- How to use Angular and its ecosystem of packages to create a single page application for the first time.
- How to use Angular Material to create form fields, cards, buttons and other HTML elements.
- Understanding how to pass data through the application with Inputs so I can dynamically render new components.
- Developed intial understanding of RxJS to manage variables in the form of observables that will register changes and alter the data.
- Expanded understanding of NgRx to store the values from my components and pass them into a singular summary component.
- How to use animations using the built in Angular module to render page elements gradually on initial page load.

<h2 align="center">What Was The Biggest Challenge</h2>

The biggest challenge I faced as using NgRx as it requires a good understanding of state managment to implement. You have to create a fair amount of boilerplate code to get it working however once you understand it, it becomes a very powerful asset. It can easily send state through your components without needing to use complex Input and Output methods. I reversed engineered the example shown in the documentation to suit my own data structure and personal requirements.
