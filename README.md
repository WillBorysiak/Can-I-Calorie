<h2 align="center">How The Application Works</h2>

- The application uses Angular to render the user interface via its component based architecture and build in modules.
- SASS and Angular Material are used to style the component either using css properties or pre-built components.
- NgRx is used to manage the state of the application by sending data from various other dashboard components to the summary component.

Work In Progress

<h2 align="center">What Was The Biggest Challenge</h2>

The biggest challenge I faced as using NgRx as it requires a good understanding of state managment to implement. You have to create a fair amount of boilerplate code to get it working however once you understand it, it becomes a very powerful asset. It can easily send state through your components without needing to use complex Input and Output methods. I reversed engineered the example shown in the documentation to suit my own data structure and personal requirements.
